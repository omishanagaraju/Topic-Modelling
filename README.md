# Topic-Modelling on State of Union Dataset
This project is to explain the working and understanding of Topic Modelling on the State of Union data from the year 1790 - 2012. Using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the corpus is transformed into TF-IDF weighted vectors to identify topics and patterns. Then an algorithm is designed to segment the corpus by decade and to find shifts corresponding to historical events such as wars, economic upheavals, social movements, and political scandals.

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook (`Topic-Modelling-Code.ipynb`) files and associated data files in CSV (`state-of-the-union.csv`, `stopwords-en.csv`) format. This README provides instructions on how to download and use these files.
